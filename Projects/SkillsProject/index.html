    <h1>Self-Guided Skill Project - Robert Blake</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In order to improve the standards I follow when I code and to help others improve their own, for my Self-Guided Skill, I chose to learn the Standards for accessibility web content. I doing so, I decided to learn as much as possible of all three major parts of any web development: Writing, Design/Formatting, and Code/Development.</p>
    <h2>Writing</h2>
    <p>While one may not think that the writing section of a website needs to be any more accessible than it already is, it's actually imperative that it follow numerous guidelines in order to better allow the likes of screenreaders to follow along with it.</p>
    <h3>Headings</h3>
    <p>One major piece of writing accessible content is splitting content into headings. Huge, unbroken blocks of text are detrimental to accessibility and fail to provide meaningful distinction and description of what is covered in a given section. The W3 guide on accessiblity says the following about headings:</p>
    <blockquote>Headings are classified into levels from one to six. The highest level is "Level 1" and often corresponds to the title of the page or major document section. Sub-headers proceed through increasing header levels. The lower the number, the smaller and more detailed a section.</blockquote>
